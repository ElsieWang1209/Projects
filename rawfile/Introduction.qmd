1. Motivation

Valentine’s Day is more than just a romantic holiday—it’s a major driver of consumer spending. Every year, people spend billions on gifts like candy, flowers, jewelry, and special outings. But what influences these spending choices? Do men and women spend differently? Does age play a role? And how have broader trends, like changes in participation rates, affected spending over time?

These are the kinds of questions we aim to explore. By looking into how demographic factors and external trends shape Valentine’s Day consumption, we can better understand how people celebrate this holiday—and how those patterns are changing. This matters not only for businesses hoping to better reach their audiences but also for anyone interested in how culture, economics, and personal choices intersect.

2. Short Explanation of Data and Methodology

This analysis utilizes publicly available datasets from TidyTuesday, including `historical_spending.csv`, `gifts_age.csv`, and `gifts_gender.csv`. The data includes detailed breakdowns of spending across product categories and demographic segments from 2010 to 2022. After transforming raw spending into experiential and practical categories, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), generated visualizations using `plotly`, and calculated relative percentage distributions to reveal meaningful patterns in the data.

3. Analytical Approach

We first cleaned and transformed the data to create grouped spending variables by category (experiential vs. practical). Using EDA, we visualized time trends, gender- and age-based differences, and percentage breakdowns. In particular, we focused on how spending differs between men and women and across age groups. A 2x2 matrix was used to reveal the proportion of total spending contributed by each group and gift type. These techniques allow us to interpret trends without relying on complex models, ensuring transparency and interpretability.

4. Purpose and Value to Consumers

By breaking down spending patterns into experiential and practical categories across different demographic groups, this analysis helps consumers better understand prevailing trends and how their behaviors compare to broader patterns. For example, individuals may gain insight into how their age group or gender typically allocates spending, potentially influencing future choices or expectations around gift-giving. Furthermore, this awareness can encourage more intentional and value-aligned consumption during seasonal events like Valentine’s Day.
