The original purpose of this data is to explore a demographic breakdown of total spending, average spending, types of gifts planned and spending per type of gift.

Gift_age have 9 variables: Age, SpedingCelebrating, Candy, Flowers, Jewelry, GreetingCards, EverningOut, Clothing, Giftcards.

    "text": "Main Question: How do external factors and demographic characteristics influence Valentine’s Day consumption behaviors?\n\n\n\n\nMotivation\n\nValentine’s Day is more than just a romantic holiday—it’s a major driver of consumer spending. Every year, people spend billions on gifts like candy, flowers, jewelry, and special outings. But what influences these spending choices? Do men and women spend differently? Does age play a role? And how have broader trends, like changes in participation rates, affected spending over time?\nThese are the kinds of questions we aim to explore. By looking into how demographic factors and external trends shape Valentine’s Day consumption, we can better understand how people celebrate this holiday—and how those patterns are changing. This matters not only for businesses hoping to better reach their audiences but also for anyone interested in how culture, economics, and personal choices intersect.\n\nShort Explanation of Data and Methodology\n\nThis analysis utilizes publicly available datasets from TidyTuesday, including historical_spending.csv, gifts_age.csv, and gifts_gender.csv. The data includes detailed breakdowns of spending across product categories and demographic segments from 2010 to 2022. After transforming raw spending into experiential and practical categories, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), generated visualizations using plotly, and calculated relative percentage distributions to reveal meaningful patterns in the data.\n\nAnalytical Approach\n\nWe first cleaned and transformed the data to create grouped spending variables by category (experiential vs. practical). Using EDA, we visualized time trends, gender- and age-based differences, and percentage breakdowns. In particular, we focused on how spending differs between men and women and across age groups. A 2x2 matrix was used to reveal the proportion of total spending contributed by each group and gift type. These techniques allow us to interpret trends without relying on complex models, ensuring transparency and interpretability.\n\nPurpose and Value to Consumers\n\nBy breaking down spending patterns into experiential and practical categories across different demographic groups, this analysis helps consumers better understand prevailing trends and how their behaviors compare to broader patterns. For example, individuals may gain insight into how their age group or gender typically allocates spending, potentially influencing future choices or expectations around gift-giving. Furthermore, this awareness can encourage more intentional and value-aligned consumption during seasonal events like Valentine’s Day."

    "text": "This analysis set out to explore how external events and demographic factors—particularly age and gender—affect Valentine’s Day spending behavior in the United States. The motivation stems from a broader interest in understanding how personal characteristics and societal disruptions influence consumer decision-making during culturally significant holidays.\nTo address this question, we used datasets from TidyTuesday, including historical_spending, gifts_age, and gifts_gender. We cleaned and transformed the data to compute experiential and practical spending categories. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), we created a series of visualizations (line plots, bar charts, and stacked plots) to examine spending trends over time, across age groups, and between genders.\nOur analysis revealed several meaningful patterns. First, the COVID-19 pandemic coincided with a shift away from experiential spending and toward practical gifts, suggesting an adaptive response to restricted social activity. Second, younger adults (ages 18–34) are more likely to celebrate Valentine’s Day and tend to spend more, with a clear preference for romantic experiences. Older age groups participate less but still lean toward experiential gifts. Finally, both men and women prioritize experiential spending, but men contribute a larger share to overall holiday spending and allocate a slightly higher proportion to romantic gestures.\nThese insights have practical relevance for marketers and retailers, who can use them to better tailor campaigns by targeting appropriate age groups and adjusting gift recommendations based on evolving consumer behavior. For consumers, the analysis offers a lens through which to reflect on their own choices in the context of broader societal patterns.\nHowever, this analysis has limitations. Most notably, the gifts_age and gifts_gender datasets provide only percentage-based figures rather than raw expenditure amounts. As a result, the classification of spending into experiential and practical categories was based on the cumulative sum of percentage values rather than exact monetary figures. This introduces potential inaccuracies in interpreting absolute spending patterns. Additionally, the use of aggregate data limits our ability to control for individual-level variation or other confounding factors. Future work could benefit from access to raw transactional or survey microdata, enabling more precise modeling and deeper insights into consumer behavior."

However, starting from 2019, which we define as the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic’s influence, we observe a marked behavioral shift:\n\nExperiential spending (e.g., dining out, flowers) declined from 2019 to 2021.\nMeanwhile, practical spending (e.g., gift cards, clothing) increased, especially in 2020 and 2022.\nDespite a drop in celebrators, total per-person spending surged in 2020 and remained elevated.\n\nThis pattern suggests a reallocation of budget rather than a reduction in gift-giving, likely due to pandemic-induced restrictions on experiences and greater emphasis on tangible, useful items.\n\nplot_ly(historical_spending_grouped, x = ~Year) |&gt;\n  add_trace(y = ~PerPerson, name = \"PerPerson\", type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers') |&gt;\n  layout(title = \"Valentine's Day

flowers.\nOlder groups (especially 55+) celebrate less and also focu on experiential gifts.\n\nThis suggests that no matter younger or older, people are more inclined to express emotions through

each group of people in the total total consumption (for example, “Women’s Experiential consumption accounts for 32.8% of the total consumption”)\n\nSummary of Findings based on following one graph:\n\nGender does influence Valentine’s Day spending behavior, but not drastically in structure:\n\nBoth men and women prioritize experiential gifts, with men allocating a slightly higher proportion of their own spending toward romantic gestures.\nMen also account for a greater share of total spending across both categories, particularly in experiential gifts.\n\nThis suggests that men tend to invest more overall in Valentine’s Day, and are marginally more romance-oriented in their spending proportions. Meanwhile, women’s spending is slightly more balanced, with a modest tilt toward experiential gifts.\n\nplot_ly(gifts_gender_grouped, x = ~Gender, y = ~ExperientialSpending, type = 'bar',\n        name = 'ExperientialSpending',\n        text = ~paste0(round(ExperientialSpending / TotalSpending * 100, 1), \"%\"),\n        textposition = 'inside') |&gt;\n  add_trace(y = ~PracticalSpending, name = 'PracticalSpending', type = 'bar',\n            text = ~paste0(round(PracticalSpending / TotalSpending * 100, 1), \"%\"),\n            textposition = 'inside') |&gt;\n  add_trace(y = ~TotalSpending, name = 'TotalSpending', type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers',\n            marker = list(color = 'black', size = 3)) |&gt;\n  layout(\n    barmode = 'stack',\n    title = \"Valentine's Day Spending Patterns by Gender\",\n    xaxis = list(title = \"Gender\", tickmode = \"linear\", dtick = 1),\n    yaxis = list(title = \"Sum Spending\"),\n    legend = list(title = list(text = \"Category\"))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(knitr)\n# Build a 2x2 matrix for Experiential and Practical Spending\nspending_matrix &lt;- rbind(\n  ExperientialSpending = gifts_gender_grouped$ExperientialSpending,\n  PracticalSpending = gifts_gender_grouped$PracticalSpending\n)\ncolnames(spending_matrix) &lt;- gifts_gender_grouped$Gender\n\n# Compute the grand total across the entire matrix\ntotal_spending_all &lt;- sum(spending_matrix)\n\n# Use apply() to compute percentages\npercent_matrix &lt;- apply(spending_matrix, c(1, 2), function(x) round(x / total_spending_all * 100, 1))\n\n# Display as a formatted table\nkable(percent_matrix, caption = \"Percent of Total Spending by Gender and Type\")\n\n\nPercent of Total Spending by Gender and Type\n\n\n\nMen\nWomen\n\n\n\n\nExperientialSpending\n38.9\n32.8\n\n\nPracticalSpending\n14.8\n13.5"

    "text": "Main Question: How do external factors and demographic characteristics influence Valentine’s Day consumption behaviors?\n\n\n\n\nMotivation\n\nValentine’s Day is more than just a romantic holiday—it’s a major driver of consumer spending. Every year, people spend billions on gifts like candy, flowers, jewelry, and special outings. But what influences these spending choices? Do men and women spend differently? Does age play a role? And how have broader trends, like changes in participation rates, affected spending over time?\nThese are the kinds of questions we aim to explore. By looking into how demographic factors and external trends shape Valentine’s Day consumption, we can better understand how people celebrate this holiday—and how those patterns are changing. This matters not only for businesses hoping to better reach their audiences but also for anyone interested in how culture, economics, and personal choices intersect.\n\nShort Explanation of Data and Methodology\n\nThis analysis utilizes publicly available datasets from TidyTuesday, including historical_spending.csv, gifts_age.csv, and gifts_gender.csv. The data includes detailed breakdowns of spending across product categories and demographic segments from 2010 to 2022. After transforming raw spending into experiential and practical categories, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), generated visualizations using plotly, and calculated relative percentage distributions to reveal meaningful patterns in the data.\n\nAnalytical Approach\n\nWe first cleaned and transformed the data to create grouped spending variables by category (experiential vs. practical). Using EDA, we visualized time trends, gender- and age-based differences, and percentage breakdowns. In particular, we focused on how spending differs between men and women and across age groups. A 2x2 matrix was used to reveal the proportion of total spending contributed by each group and gift type. These techniques allow us to interpret trends without relying on complex models, ensuring transparency and interpretability.\n\nPurpose and Value to Consumers\n\nBy breaking down spending patterns into experiential and practical categories across different demographic groups, this analysis helps consumers better understand prevailing trends and how their behaviors compare to broader patterns. For example, individuals may gain insight into how their age group or gender typically allocates spending, potentially influencing future choices or expectations around gift-giving. Furthermore, this awareness can encourage more intentional and value-aligned consumption during seasonal events like Valentine’s Day."
