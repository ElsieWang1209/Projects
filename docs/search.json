    "text": "Main Question: How do external factors and demographic characteristics influence Valentine’s Day consumption behaviors?\n\n\n\n\nMotivation\n\nValentine’s Day is more than just a romantic holiday—it’s a major driver of consumer spending. Every year, people spend billions on gifts like candy, flowers, jewelry, and special outings. But what influences these spending choices? Do men and women spend differently? Does age play a role? And how have broader trends, like changes in participation rates, affected spending over time?\nThese are the kinds of questions we aim to explore. By looking into how demographic factors and external trends shape Valentine’s Day consumption, we can better understand how people celebrate this holiday—and how those patterns are changing. This matters not only for businesses hoping to better reach their audiences but also for anyone interested in how culture, economics, and personal choices intersect.\n\nShort Explanation of Data and Methodology\n\nThis analysis utilizes publicly available datasets from TidyTuesday, including historical_spending.csv, gifts_age.csv, and gifts_gender.csv. The data includes detailed breakdowns of spending across product categories and demographic segments from 2010 to 2022. After transforming raw spending into experiential and practical categories, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), generated visualizations using plotly, and calculated relative percentage distributions to reveal meaningful patterns in the data.\n\nAnalytical Approach\n\nWe first cleaned and transformed the data to create grouped spending variables by category (experiential vs. practical). Using EDA, we visualized time trends, gender- and age-based differences, and percentage breakdowns. In particular, we focused on how spending differs between men and women and across age groups. A 2x2 matrix was used to reveal the proportion of total spending contributed by each group and gift type. These techniques allow us to interpret trends without relying on complex models, ensuring transparency and interpretability.\n\nPurpose and Value to Consumers\n\nBy breaking down spending patterns into experiential and practical categories across different demographic groups, this analysis helps consumers better understand prevailing trends and how their behaviors compare to broader patterns. For example, individuals may gain insight into how their age group or gender typically allocates spending, potentially influencing future choices or expectations around gift-giving. Furthermore, this awareness can encourage more intentional and value-aligned consumption during seasonal events like Valentine’s Day."

However, starting from 2019, which we define as the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic’s influence, we observe a marked behavioral shift:\n1.Experiential spending (e.g., dining out, flowers) declined from 2019 to 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, practical spending (e.g., gift cards, clothing) increased, especially in 2020 and 2022.\n\n3.Despite a drop in celebrators, total per-person spending surged in 2020 and remained elevated.\nThis pattern suggests a reallocation of budget rather than a reduction in gift-giving, likely due to pandemic-induced restrictions on experiences and greater emphasis on tangible, useful items.\n\nplot_ly(historical_spending_grouped, x = ~Year) |&gt;\n  add_trace(y = ~PerPerson, name = \"PerPerson\", type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers') |&gt;\n  layout(title =

different age groups in terms of “Experiential” and “Practical” expenditures.\nPlot7: Show the total expenditure structure for each age group.\n\nSummary of Findings based on following three graphs:\n\nThere are clear generational differences in both participation and spending behavior for Valentine’s Day.\n1.Younger age groups, especially 18–24 and 25–34, are more likely to celebrate the holiday and spend more overall.\n2.These groups also show a strong preference for experiential spending, suggesting that younger people tend to value romantic experiences such as dining out or giving flowers.\n\nOlder groups (especially 55+) celebrate less and also focu on experiential gifts.\n\nThis suggests that no matter younger or older, people are more inclined to express emotions through romantic experiential gifts.\n\nplot_ly(gifts_age_grouped, x = ~Age) |&gt;\n  add_trace(y = ~SpendingCelebrating, name = \"PerPerson\", type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers') |&gt;\n  layout(title

each group of people in the total total consumption (for example, “Women’s Experiential consumption accounts for 32.8% of the total consumption”)\n\nSummary of Findings based on following one graph:\n\nGender does influence Valentine’s Day spending behavior, but not drastically in structure:\n1.Both men and women prioritize experiential gifts, with men allocating a slightly higher proportion of their own spending toward romantic gestures.\n\nMen also account for a greater share of total spending across both categories, particularly in experiential gifts.\n\nThis suggests that men tend to invest more overall in Valentine’s Day, and are marginally more romance-oriented in their spending proportions. Meanwhile, women’s spending is slightly more balanced, with a modest tilt toward experiential gifts.\n\nplot_ly(gifts_gender_grouped, x = ~Gender, y = ~ExperientialSpending, type = 'bar',\n        name = 'ExperientialSpending',\n        text = ~paste0(round(ExperientialSpending / TotalSpending * 100, 1), \"%\"),\n        textposition = 'inside') |&gt;\n  add_trace(y = ~PracticalSpending, name = 'PracticalSpending', type = 'bar',\n            text = ~paste0(round(PracticalSpending / TotalSpending * 100, 1), \"%\"),\n            textposition = 'inside') |&gt;\n  add_trace(y = ~TotalSpending, name = 'TotalSpending', type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers',\n            marker = list(color = 'black', size = 3)) |&gt;\n  layout(\n    barmode = 'stack',\n    title = \"Valentine's Day Spending Patterns by Gender\",\n    xaxis = list(title = \"Gender\", tickmode = \"linear\", dtick = 1),\n    yaxis = list(title = \"Sum Spending\"),\n    legend = list(title = list(text = \"Category\"))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(knitr)\n# Build a 2x2 matrix for Experiential and Practical Spending\nspending_matrix &lt;- rbind(\n  ExperientialSpending = gifts_gender_grouped$ExperientialSpending,\n  PracticalSpending = gifts_gender_grouped$PracticalSpending\n)\ncolnames(spending_matrix) &lt;- gifts_gender_grouped$Gender\n\n# Compute the grand total across the entire matrix\ntotal_spending_all &lt;- sum(spending_matrix)\n\n# Use apply() to compute percentages\npercent_matrix &lt;- apply(spending_matrix, c(1, 2), function(x) round(x / total_spending_all * 100, 1))\n\n# Display as a formatted table\nkable(percent_matrix, caption = \"Percent of Total Spending by Gender and Type\")\n\n\nPercent of Total Spending by Gender and Type\n\n\n\nMen\nWomen\n\n\n\n\nExperientialSpending\n38.9\n32.8\n\n\nPracticalSpending\n14.8\n13.5"
